This is a game that I created to mimic https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states 
In this game, I practiced using the turtle (for graphic) and pandas (for manipulating csv data) libraries.
I also tried to organise my code following OOP. I really struggled in how to organise my code following OOP, and that led to hours of debugging, and made me very frustrated. 
Anyway, itâ€™s now working properly. Thanks for your feedback!
